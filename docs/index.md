## Harry Clegg

Harry received his Electronic Engineering MEng from the University of Leeds in 2018. During his time at Leeds, he found himself developing a keen interest in embedded systems, software development, and digital signal processing. 

Harry decided to stay and pursue a PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Leeds within the [Ultrasound Group](https://uarp.co.uk) under Dr David Cowell and Professor Steven Freear. He was awarded the degree in April 2023. Harry's thesis was titled *[Integrated control and signal processing software for next generation open ultrasound research platforms](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/32659/)*.
